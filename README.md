# SALT_RV_Pipeline
This is a pipeline I have developed to obtain radial velocities from the Southern African Large Telescope. I've based this on a cross-correlation method between an observed and template spectrum, resulting in radial velocity precisions at the ~0.5 km/s level. This was developed to ascertain radial velocities of potential Ursa Major Moving Group targets. 

Although not its own publication, if you find this helpful, the most relevant citation currently is 2024AAS...24430502D, although this will be updated once the Ursa Major work is completed.
